The Statehelm graveyard may seem an ordinary one, but it was actually configured by the Council to support extreme necromantic rituals. You can use that place to pull Grosark into our realm now, while he is weak and confused. It's the only way. Aside from the myriad other ways, of course, but it's the only way I recommend.\n\nHere are the notes. Follow them diligently. And bring a friend. No, bring an army! No, that would be chaos. Bring between five and fifteen friends.\n\nOh! You'll need a summoning candle. Can you make them? No, nevermind, let me teach you precisely how to make it safely. No sense getting you turned into an ectoplasmic pudding. It's a relatively simple candle... I trust you know your way around a candlemaking station? There's one conveniently located in the crypt.",

It turns out Chalice is in close alignment with Alharth right now, and they're flooding the continent with undead!\n\nI have some friends on Alharth so I figured I'd help them out... by helping YOU out! You're pretty strong and I think you can help fix this. And we'll have some fun along the way, too. Stick with me, mortal, and you won't regret it!\n\n<i>[Check your quest journal for quests to get you started. Complete those quests and you'll unlock additional quests.

It's just lying in the snow in Kur. Look for a campfire near a stream, close to an orc settlement.\n\nAnd listen: Mort's technically alive, so killing him is murder. BUT! He was dead, and UN-dead, off and on, for like fifty years before he made some kind of pact with Harukita. So don't sweat the murder thing.

We were hiking through the forests south of here, as young lovers do, and came upon a bear with green fur. Lennel was a strong man but stupid, and he tried to hit it with a longbow. The bear killed him, scattering blood everywhere, and then it did the most cursed thing: it picked up his bow, stared right into my eyes, and snapped the bow over its knee. It was a very human thing to do.\n\nI learned that the locals call him the Mangler. And I promise you this: it has been decades, but my hatred still runs deep.
